    <h3>Text Adventure Game</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>With using Python, we will make a text adventure game where you are a stranded person on an island trying to find a way to survive and escape. 
        But the catch is, there are unknown entities lurking around. What are they? It's up to you to find out.
    </p>
    <h4> End Users</h4>
    <p>Our end users revolve around teenagers mainly around the range of age 13-16. Specifically, wei'll target those who favour in fictional
        books and novels, as well as those who have an interest in thrilling and action-packed content. We also aim to target other teenagers that 
        usually are familiar with simple and easy to understand content, meaning what we're going to make won't be too long and boring as we consider
        all of our end users.
    </p>
    <h4> Requirements</h4>
        <ul> Replayability </ul>
            <li>Many ways to end the game/story</li>
            <li>Many events will be randomized</li>
            <li>The entire play time of the game will not be too long.</li>
        <ul> Simple and Understandable </ul>
            <li>Story will not be too complex and not too twisted and rather straightforward.</li>
            <li>Vocabulary implementing will be minimal for the narrative and plot. Simple words will be
                considered instead.
            </li>
        <ul> Thrilling and Action </ul>
            <li>The game will be balanced fairly and the difficulty will be justified.</li>
            <li>People can be anticipated to unlock more than 1 ending to the game.</li>
            <li>The enemies in the story migh be interesting.</li>
        <ul> Interactive </ul>
            <li>Maybe some hidden easter eggs and references</li>
            <li>Many options to choose from.</li>

    <h4> Implications</h4>
        <ul> Aesthetics </ul>
            <li>There are only a few things to consider when it comes to aesthetics. We plan to implement the use of Ascii art in order to help tell
                the story and direct the narrative in a much more visual and effective way. We could also try to change the color of the text if it is
                a guaranteed possibility in Python in order to help set the tone and mood of the storyline.
            </li>
        <ul> Functionality </ul>  
            <li>The coding might get confusing at times, so many tests and debugging will be considered when coding the entirety of the game. We plan to run
                the game a number of times in order to clear it of any glitches or bugs. We will also make sure that the question format will be multiple choice,
                and have the A,B,C & D options working regardless of a lower or uppercase input. One more thing are the outcomes and events that happen in the story.
                We plan to code a rarity into the game if possible, so that there might be a sense of randomness in some parts of the game.
            </li>
        <ul> Usability </ul>
            <li>The game will feature simple instructions along with its simple format. The prompts and messages will be clear and concise so that nobody might get confused.
                And as said before, all questions will be multiple choice, just so it is easier to operate within and that there will not be too much unnecessary guessing.
            </li>
        <ul> Intellectual Property </ul>
            <li> As we are aware of copyright, we plan to replace and change some content that we have took inspiration from. We can slightly change the concepts like adding
                and removing certain parts that we think feels copied and try to put our own spin on it, in order to give out as much originality as possible, despite having 
                most concepts inspired from certain media.
            </li>

    <h3>Low Poly Character</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>This project revolves around the development of a low-poly character. This character can be used for any form of media. I plan to create this character
        either a human, monster or both at the same time, depends on how I like the final product.
    </p>
    <h4> End Users</h4>
    <p>The end users for this project are for children and teenagers around the age range of 9-17. Preferrably, they can be male too. These end users
        prefer simple looking characters and sometimes goofy looking things. They also wish to see more movements and animations in order to be kept engaged.
    </p>
    <h4> Requirements</h4>
        <ul> Eyes </ul>
            <li>Circular shape</li>
            <li>Simple black and white</li>
            <li>Medium - small size</li>
        <ul> Mouth </ul>
            <li>Not too detailed</li>
            <li>Simple black line</li>
            <li>have small simple teeth</li>
        <ul> Body </ul>
            <li>Human/Monster combination</li>
            <li>Could be deformed for uniqueness and originality</li>
            <li>Simple animations, with legs and rigging</li>
    <h4> Implications</h4>
        <ul> Aesthetics </ul>
            <li>I prioritize this in order to make my character look good for gameplay as well as making the player feel pleased to the eye. I do this by using color
                theory in order to know which combinations look pleasing to the eye, as well as being aware on where I color the parts of the character for their appearance.</li>
        <ul> Functionality </ul>  
            <li>This is about how I expect my character to function. Using simple concepts can make it better for the way my character works and not by using more 
                difficult concepts.</li>
        <ul> Usability </ul>
            <li>The way my character functions should be simple and easy for everyone to learn during gameplay. It needs simple controls like a few inputs and not something
                that should be overdone.</li>
